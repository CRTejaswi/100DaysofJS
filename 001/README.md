## What's Next?
- Add Lap-timer, to measure time-duration of repetitive activities.\
_eg. Running laps around a public park._

    The Lap-timer must display timings in both relative & absolute units.\
    _eg. If you run the first and second laps in 00:10:30 and 00:09:45 respectively, the output should look something like this -_

  |#Lap | Timing |  Timing |
  |:---:|  :---: |  :---:  |
  |  1  |00:10:30|+00:10:30|
  |  2  |00:20:15|+00:09:45|

- Add millisecond value to improve timing precision.
- Export timing records to a CSV or JSON file.
- Publish the utility as a Chrome/Firefox extension.
